   that since yesterday her mother had not been herself.  She was more
   tired appearing than usual and not eating well.  Prior to this she was

   a mild cause and hypoxia to the 80s.  Given her condition they were
   concerned for pneumonia and sent to the ED.

   performed, showing bilat pneumonia.  She intermittently took off her

   cefepime, and levoflox 750mg, though the levoflox was stopped [**1-2**] 
way
   through due to reddness at PIV site.  She was also found to have poor
   UOP of 10ml -> given 500ml NS.  Given her low UOP and hypoxia, she was
