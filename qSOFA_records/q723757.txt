Chief Complaint:  bright red blood per colostomy
   HPI:
   84 y/o F with hx of COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia and recent perforated
   sigmoid diverticulitis on [**1-5**] s/p ex lap, sigmoid colectomy with
   [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 **].  She was transferred to 
[**Hospital1 5**] surgical service on
   [**2135-1-17**] after her course was complicated by respiratory failure 
with
   persistent L lower lung collapse, acute renal failure and altered
   mental status.  While in the surgical ICU from [**1-17**] to 
[**2-17**], she was
   found to have pulmonary abscesses and started on vanco, zosyn and
   cipro.  She improved hemodynamically, but has slow recovery of mental
   status.  She had a trach and PEG tube placed for failure to wean of
   ventilator.  A pneumothorax occurred after CVL placement and a CT was
   placed.  During the admission, she also had unexplained neutropenia and
   a BM biopsy.  For diarrhea, she was empirically treated for c.diff,
   although no cultures were positive.
   .
   She was recently seen in ED at OSH for possible pneumonia and treated
   with unknown abx at that time at rehab.  Was not admitted.  Also
   talking with rehab, she is on a course of IV flagyl for c.diff.  She in
   on day [**12-20**] today.
   .
   Today she presents from rehab with bright red blood per her colostomy
   for the last 48 hours.  Also had some blood sputum through her
   tracheostomy per report.  Her family is with her and notes that the
   last few days she seems more tired than usual but otherwise well.  No
   nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  Stool is maroon.  No stool output
   from her pouch.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4, 116/71, hr 110, r 12, 98% on PS 5/5
   with 60% FiO2.  She was given cipro 400 mg IV x1 in the ED.  Her prior
   PICC site was very erythematous.  Her PICC had been removed at rehab
   the day prior to admission.  She had a CXR without new cardiopulmonary
   abnormalities; her trach was in place.  An NG lavage was attempted but
   unsuccessful via NG tube.  She had a lavage through her PEG tube which
   was negative.  She had [**Last Name (un) 2650**]-maroon stool in her 
bag.  Her vitals on
   transfer were P 113, BP 108/60, R 20, 94% on above vent settings.  She
   had 2 peripheral IVs for access.
   .
   On the floor, she is awake and arousable, but not able to talk because
   of her trach.  She nods.  She nods no to having no pain.  Otherwise
   yes/no review of systems was negative as listed below.  Her weight has
   been stable, although she is being diuresed for fluid overload from
   previous admission.  She does have decubitus ulcers.
   .
   Review of systems:
   (+) Per HPI
   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
   Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
   cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest
   pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

   Findings:
   Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
   Stomach:
   -Mucosa: Diffuse erythema and friability of the mucosa with no bleeding
   were noted in the stomach body and fundus. These findings are
   compatible with significant gastritis.
   -Excavated Lesions Multiple superficial ulcers ranging in size from 5
   mm to 6 mm were found in the stomach body close to the PEG tube site.
   The ulcers were covered by adherent clots. No visible vessels or
   evidence of active bleeding were found. No intervention was required at
   this moment. The lesions were likely stress ulcers.
   -Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
   -Impression: Ulcers in the stomach body.
   Erythema and friability in the stomach body and fundus compatible with
   significant gastritis.
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
   .
   [**2135-2-9**] Echo
   No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
   contrast at rest (although the agitated saline contrast study was
   suboptimal due to limited IV access with slow flow). The left
   ventricular cavity is unusually small likely related to intravascular
   volume depletion. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There are complex (>4mm) nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch.
   There are complex (>4mm) nonmobile atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta to 32 cm. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly to moderately
   thickened with focal calcifications. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   .
   IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen. No intracardiac source of
   embolus identified; however, complex atheroma were noted in the aortic
   arch and descending aorta. Small left ventricular cavity suggestive of
   low preload/intravascular volume depletion.
   .
   * Has hx of hepatic cysts and cholelithiasis on other scans.
   Microbiology: none
   ECG: sinus tach with LBBB, unchanged from previous ekgs
   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   84 y/o F with complicated past medical history including perforated
   sigmoid diverticulitis with prolonged hospital course complicated by
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and peg who presents today with bright red
   blood per her ostomy.
   .
   # GI Bleed: patient with complicated history of recent perforated
   diverticulitis s/p sigmoid colectomy who now presents with heme
   positive red-maroon stools per colostomy.  Has pink heme positive
   mucous in [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch.  Has hx of ulcerations around 
PEG tube site
   on previous endoscopy without obvious bleeding.  H.pylori was negative
   at that time.  Likely is from lower GI source as PEG lavage was
   negative.  Possibly has another diverticular bleed in remaining colon.
   She did have a sigmoidoscopy was performed during her last admission of
   her [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch that was normal.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - active type and cross; transfuse for hct <25
   - GI consult; no plan for endoscopy or colonoscopy today
   - surgery consult; recommends serial hcts and transfusions as needed
   - IR contact[**Name (NI) **] about possibility for RBC scan and angio 
if hemodynamics
   change or begins having high output of blood
   - INR 1.8, likely related to poor nutritional status; IV vit K today
   .
   # C.diff: is mid-course from rehab; not having copious amounts of stool
   now.
   - will add flagyl to above antibiotics
   - check c.diff
   .
   # R arm erythema: has erythema at old PICC site, no fevers, chills,
   sweats reported.  No swelling of the extremity.
   - outline erythema
   - follow up blood cultures
   - treat with vanco/cefepime today; had pancytopenia to zosyn her last
   admission.  Will talk with ID when getting approval if there is
   possibility of similar reaction with cefepime
   - consider RUE ultrasound
   .
   # Chronic Ventilator Dependence: had recent pneumonia, was discharged
   from here on trach mask.  Is tolerating PS 5/5 right now and
   comfortable.  Had improved CXR today without signs of infection.
   - continue PS tonight
   - consider TM trial tomorrow
   .
   # Fluid Overload: edematous from fluid resuccitation in previous
   admission; on diuretics IV at rehab.
   - hold now in setting of GI bleed
   - monitor respiratory status, CXR clear this evening
   - be cautious with IVFs
   .
   # Hx of elevated Alk Phos and benign liver cysts and cholelithasis: she
   is not having abdominal pain, and exam is benign, but patient is not a
   great historian about pain.
   - check LFTs
   - consider US if abnormal in AM
   .
   # Decubitus ulcer, stage 3: no surrounding erythema or signs of
   infection on exam around ulcer.
   - wound care consult
   - check albumin
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: had her levothyroxine titrated upward during her
   admission last time.  Not symptomatic, although is tachycardic at
   baseline per family.
   - check TSH
   - continue dose of levothyroxine via conversion
   .
   # Hx of ARF: stable creatinine today at her baseline, continue to trend
   creatinine daily
   .
   # Hx of neutropenia: BM biopsy last admission was concerning for
   infectious/inflammatory vs. T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.  Now,
   her counts have recovered.
   - trend CBC
   - outpatient heme follow up as planned in previous admission
   .
   # Hx of possible HIT: will avoid heparin, pneumonboots here
   .
   # Diabetes: patient NPO, continue fingersticks and insulin sliding
   scale as needed
   .
   # HTN: stable, off her old home meds; monitor BP
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: stable, not on statin at rehab
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, holding TFs, hold reglan; at rehab
   are Replete with Fiber, 65 ml/hr; NS flushes 200 ml qshift
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots; start SQ heparin once source of bleed
   stabalized, no SQ heparin for now
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient, family; son and [**Name2 (NI) **] at bedside
