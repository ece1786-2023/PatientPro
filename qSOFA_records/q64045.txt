Chief Complaint:  UGIB
   HPI:
   This is a 70 year-old male with a history ofIDDM, PVD s/p L BKA, h/o of
   TIA, CAD s/p stent in [**2107**], s/p PPM for asystole, HTN, HLD, neurogenic
   bladder with self catherization, peripheral neuropathy initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 19**] with urospesis and c/b stroke and coffee ground
   emesis.
   .
   Please see admission note for full details. Briefly, the patient
   resides at a nursing for the last year after right hip fracture.  He
   was scheduled catheterization for neurogenic bladder at baseline.  He
   reportly had r eye pain w/ discharge, + coffee ground emesis and fevers
   to 102, a foley placed that returned "puss" and was given CTX 1g x2 and
   transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  In the ED he was guaiac negative,
   delirious (AAOx2) and combative. A CT a/p was negative for an acute
   process.  Hct was 37.8 and 11.0. On the floor the patient continued to
   have nausea and vomiting. Then at 5:35pm the patient's wife noticed
   that he had new onset of L-sided neglect and L facial weakness. A code
   stroke was called and CT-head did not show any acute process.  He was
   evaluated by neurology and neuro exam improved.  They were concerned of
   an embolic event given his frequent episodes of TIA.  They recommended
   starting plavix and remaining on the medicine service.
   .
   The patient triggered twice in 1 hour for coffee ground emesis, fevers
   to 101.4 and SBP >200 and nursing concern.  CE negative x3. Antibiotics
   were changed from po cipro back to IV CTX, IV PPI was started and
   transferred to the ICU for closer management.
   .
   On arrive the patient was AAOx3. He had complaints of nausea. He denied
   NSAID use, h/o GI bleed or varices.  An NG-tube was placed lavaged with
   1L that was initially coffee ground that cleared after 800cc. Patient's
   Hct was 32.2 (32.8 at 6pm, but 37.8 on admission).

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 70 year-old male with a history ofIDDM, PVD s/p L BKA, h/o of
   TIA, CAD s/p stent in [**2107**], s/p PPM for asystole, HTN, HLD, neurogenic
   bladder with self catherization, peripheral neuropathy initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 19**] with urospesis and c/b stroke and coffee ground
   emesis.
   .
   Plan:
   #. UGIB: Pt with multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis. Pt has had
   nausea and episodes of vomiting intermittently prior to and during
   admission. No h/o NSAID or prior UGIB. Pt with prior EGD [**1-/2117**] that
   was negative. Pt with coffee ground with lavage that cleared after
   800cc. Likely [**Doctor First Name 241**]-[**Last Name (un) **] tear in the setting of multiple episodes of
   vomiting.  Also on the differential include PUD and less likely
   malignancy, varices or AVM.  Hct has trended down from 37 to 32, but
   stable over the last 6 hrs.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 70 y/o, male, with multiple medical issues
   who was admitted to the floor yesterday from nursing home with coffee
   ground emesis, fever, and
 in the urine on foley
   catheterization.Was started on antibiotics. While on the floor, was
   noted by wife to have left sided neglect and left facial weakness, CT
   head was negative, stroke team called and thought to be TIA.Was started
   on Plavix. He triggered multiple times on the floor for fever, vomiting
coffee ground
 and SBP 200.Was transferred to CCU for closer
   observation. Had NG lavage with coffee ground that cleared after 800
   ml. Started on PPI and continued on antibiotics. No focal neurologic
   findings.
   Exam notable for Tm 39 BP 160/70 HR 82 RR 24 with sat 97% on N/C. Labs
   notable for WBC 11.2K, HCT 32.2, K+ 3.0, Cr 1.2, lactate 1.4, Trop
   0.03. CXR with no acute process, EKG V-paced.
   Agree with plan to hold Plavix for now, continue with PPI, follow HCT,
   BP control, repeat head CT in AM, neuron checks, TTE to check for any
   embolic source for TIA, follow cardiac enzymes, continue with IV
   antibiotics and check with GI and stroke services.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
