   Imaging: [**3-8**] CXR: Right base effusion and collapse and/or
   consolidation, similar to
   [**2178-3-7**].
   [**3-8**] CT PFI: -Right middle and right lower lobe air space 
consolidation
   with associated
   small right pleural effusion, most likely in keeping with an infectious
   etiology. However, given the history of chronicity of this findings,
   although an acute-on-chronic presentation is most likely, an underlying
   neoplasm such as lymphoma or BAC cannot be excluded. Follow-up
   radiographs to
   confirm resolution is suggested.
   -bilateral apical emphysema
   -mild/mod aortic vascular calcification and three-vessel coronary calc.
   -no acute intra-abdominal abnormalities
   -wide neck ventral hernia containing colon

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O VALVE REPLACEMENT, AORTIC BIOPROSTHETIC (AVR)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   82 M with COPD, asplenic, w/ bioprosthetic aortic valve, who presents
   with a community acquired pneumonia, elevated INR and dropping
   hematocrit.
   # CAP: Afebrile, but WBC continues to climb, CXR still shows RLL/RML
   consolidation. Has had chronic consolidations here in past. Ctx and
   Azithro day 3.
   - f/u cx
   - CT chest for chronic RLL changes in setting of h/o RCC and colon
   cancers
   - given remote splenectomy, check vaccinations are up to date
   #Anemia & Elevated INR: Has had a 9-point crit drop since admission,
   brown well-formed guiac + stools.
   - CT abd/pelvis today to eval for retroperitoneal bleed
   - No transfusion required yet
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury- in setting of volume depletion
   received IVF yesterday; Creatinine 2.3 fallen to 2.0. Baseline 1.6-1.8
   - Will encourage PO fluids
   # COPD- not on any nebs as outpatient
   - ipra/alb nebs prn
   - add steroids if persistent wheezing
   # Atrial fibrillation
   - restart coumadin given INR back to therapeutic range
   - recheck INR to make sure we have not overshot with Vitamin K, if INR
   subtherapeutic start Heparin
   - continue Digoxin
   - continue home Metoprolol but change dosing to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Supratherapeutic INR has now been brought down to
   therapeutic, may need Heparin if drops subtherapeutic
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: ICU pending stable hematocrit
