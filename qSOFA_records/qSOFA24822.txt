Chief Complaint:  transferred for management of new seizure and
   unresponsiveness
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1136**] is an 84 year old male with past medical history of CAD
   status-post CABG in [**2103**], systolic CHF, TIA and adenocarinoma of brain
   s/p resection, DVT and PE s/p IVC filter who had witnessed tonic-clonic
   seizure and subsequent unresponsiveness. Patient developed shortness of
   breath at his long term care facility yesterday and desatted to 88%.
   Per EMS report he developed focal R sided sz that then generalized to
   tonic clonic sz while in the ambulance. He was initially transported to
   [**Hospital3 534**] where he was dilantin loaded and then transferred to
   [**Hospital1 54**] for further care.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 54**] ED, initial vs were: T100.8 P77 BP97/62 R14 O2 sat99% on
   BIPAP. TMax in the ED was 102.8. Head CT from [**Hospital1 **] was re-read as
   post-craniotomy with possible residual tumor. UA found to be suggestive
   of UTI. CXR showed L sided pleural effusion.  He received Vancomycin,
   Levofloxacin and 2g ceftriaxone.
   .
   In the ICU, patient on BIPAP. He moves both of his legs to light touch
   but is not moving his upper extremities.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, CHF, adenocarcinoma of the brain s/p
   resection in [**7-7**] and DVT/PE who presents with new onset tonic clonic
   seizure and now persistently unresponsive.
   .
   # Obtundation: Patient remains non-verbal and unresponsive. Given
   witnessed seizure activity this could certainly represent a post-ictal
   state. Since he is also febrile with leukocytosis must also consider
   CNS infection, which could possibly also account for sz. Unlikely
   stroke given findings of head CT not suggestive. Would expect that if
   this was [**3-2**] hypercapnia this would have improved on BIPAP, if CO2
   trending down.
   - Hold off on LP at this time given concern for possible mild midline
   shift. Will cover for meningitis empirically with ceftriaxone and
   acyclovir.
   - Continuous EEG monitoring to r/o status
   - Follow ABGs
   - F/U Neuro recs: Discuss goal dilantin level
   - F/U final head CT read. MRI not possible given pacemaker in place.
   .
   #  Sepsis: Pt hypotensive to 88-89 systolic on arrival to ICU.
   Pressures have responded to 1L fluid bolus. Given dirty UA and
   leukocytosis this could represent urosepsis. Must also be concerned
   about bacteremia given many open sores. PNA also possibility though
   chest xray does not clearly show any infiltrates.
   - cont IVF boluses, titrate to MAPs>60
   - consider central access (family would prefer PICC to central line)
   - ABX coverage with ceftriaxone, cipro, vanco
   - monitor fever curve and trend leukocytosis
   - follow CVP
   - follow lactate
   - f/u blood and urine cxs
   .
   #  Seizure: New onset sz for this patient. Concerning that CT head
   shows new areas of hyperdensity as well as ?mild midline shift.
   Possible mass effect and edema could contribute to sz. Given infection
   must also consider this as an inciting factor. He is not on meds that
   are associated with lowering sz threshold.
   - EEG as pre above
   - discuss dilantin dosing with renal
   - cont to monitor
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Unclear if ABG measured while pt on a trial off
   BIPAP as he was reportedly started on BIPAP at OSH.
   - recheck ABG
   - pt DNR/DNI so intubation not an option. depending on results of gas
   could consider dc'ing BIPAP.
   .
   # PAF: Hold Amiodarone for now given sepsis and concern for further
   hypotension. Pt currently rate controlled.
   - check coags
   - hold amio
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: Hold carvedilol and furosemide given sepsis.
   .
   # h/o DVT/PE: Cont Lovenox 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # CAD/s/p CABG: Pt with troponin bump of 0.2 though flat CKs. Most
   likely this elevation related to sepsis and possible sz activity. ECG
   did not suggest ischemia.
   - cont to trend CEs
   - hold BB as per above
