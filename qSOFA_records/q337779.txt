Chief Complaint:  Lethargy and Fever
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   61 year old Haitan-speaking male with history of CVA, neurogenic
   bladder, suprpubic cath, partial bowel obstruction s/p colostomy
   transferred from NH after EMS found him to have temperature of 104
   degrees, hypoxia.  On arrival to the ED, temp 103.5.  Received 4 liters
   of fluids, given vanc, cefepime.  CXR with bibasilar infiltrates and
   urine consistent with UTI.  Transferred to ICU for persistent
   tachycardia.  Oriented to person and place and unable to provide

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: urinalysis: + WBCs, RBCs
   Imaging: CXR: bibasilar infiltrates
   Assessment and Plan
   1)       Fever/sepsis: source likely urine or potentially pneumonic
   component: Hemodynamically stable, urine output > 30 cc, and lactate
   normal
   - On vancomycin and Cefepime
   - Urology to evaluate supra-pubic tube as drainage present
   - IVFs as needed to maintain urine output and hemodynamics though
   currently doing well
   2)       Hypoxia: currently minimal oxygen requirement on nasal
   cannula.  With bibasilar infiltrates and high fevers, likely some
   pneumonic component of infection or acute lung injury secondary to
   urine source.  While PE is in differential, this diagnosis would be
   unlikely in the face of other explanations.  Will treat underlying
   infection and follow.
   3)       Mental status changes: likely secondary to underlying
   infection and seems to be improving.  Will follow.
   4)       Slightly increased troponin likely demand ischemia
   5)       Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal.  Will hyrdate and
   follow urine output and BUN/cr
   6)       Acute on chronic lower extremity pain: US negative for DVTs
   7)       DM
