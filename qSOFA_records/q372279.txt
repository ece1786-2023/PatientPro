   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] yom now with sepsis.
   Sepsis -- Elevated WBC, fever, elevated lactic acid.  Responding to
   current managment.  Concerns include urine source, recurrent C. diff,
   or pneumonia (less likely).   Continue current level of care, including
   empirical Vancomycin and Cefepime
   DIARRHEA -- Likely contributing to hypovolemia.  Concern for recurrent
   C. Diff --> empirical Flagyl or Vanco PO.
   A-FIB -- Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response.  Likely
   exacerbated by sepsis.  Continue diltiazem 90mg QID, and metoprolol
   100mg TID.  Monitor HR, goal <120.  Poor anticoagulation candidate.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -  likely hypovolemia, prerenal.  Improving.
   Monitor BUN, creat, UO.  Renal dose medications.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- attributed to free water loss, reduced PO intake,
   insensibble losses.  Provide free H2O
   MENTAL STATUS -- non-communicative and non-verbal at baseline.  Subtle
   clinical decline according to family.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  replete. Follow I/O.
