   s/p whole brain XRT in [**6-29**] who presented to the ED with weakness and
   lightheadedness. Of note, her last chemo was on [**2144-1-29**] and had one shot
   of Neupogen on [**2144-1-30**] and she was to return for 2 more doses of
   Neupogen but she did not make it ([**2144-1-31**], [**2144-2-1**]). On the day of

   Coumadin.
   In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.3 HR 73 BP 110/50 RR 18 O2sat 100%
   4L NC. She was found to be hypotensive transiently to 90/40 which
   improved with 250 bolus of NS. She was also given Zofran for nausea x
   1, dilaudid for pain, and vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl for a presumed
   infection. Bedside TTE revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion. A
   right IJ CVL was placed for central access. She had a CTA which was
   negative for PE. She was c/o right LE pain and she had a CT which was
   negative. CXR was negative. CT abdomen was negative. RLE U/S revealed
   her known DVT.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she was normotensive and had an episode of
   nausea and vomiting, 300 mL of undigested food.
   ROS: Denies F/C. Positive for N/V x 1 episode after arrival to the ICU.

   Social History:
   1. Cardiomyopathy [**1-25**] Adriamycin. TTE [**2142-2-16**]: Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed with EF 25-30%. Most recent TTE
   [**5-/2143**] shows LVEF 50%.
   2. OA s/p 2 knee replacements, [**2134**] and another in [**2136**]
   3. Metastatic breast cancer to lung, liver, [**Last Name (LF) 793**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]: Her
   oncological problem began in [**2133**] when her primary care
   physician palpated [**Name Initial (PRE) **] mass in her right breast. She underwent a right
   mastectomy and 2 lymph nodes were involved. The pathologic diagnosis
   was inflammatory breast carcinoma and it was ER positive. She later
   received cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and 5-FU, followed by chest
   irradiation. She was put on Tamoxifen for 2 years, but later switched
   to Arimidex.  In [**7-28**], she developed metastatic disease and her tumor
   markers were rising. She was taken off hormonal therapy and put on
   taxol and Avastin. She then received navelbine, and more recently Doxil
   (so far, she had 2 cycles). She is currently on Doxil. She has
   [**Month/Day (1) 793**]/liver mets and mediastinal adenopathy ([**Month/Day (1) 793**] mets to T12, iliac
   crest, L2/L3. In [**1-29**] CT head showed multiple areas of cerebral
   calcifications--however pt . In [**2-27**] repeat CT of torso showed
   regression of all of her mets and she had decreased tumor markers. She
   is s/p whole brain radiation in [**6-29**].
