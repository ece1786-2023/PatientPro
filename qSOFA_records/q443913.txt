   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Given intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on
   differential though extremely unlikely given patient is overall
   non-toxic.
   - Speak to GI re: timing of endoscopy
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <22 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to 
dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   falling after hydration.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed, will d/w
   urology
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -TSH WNL and T4 pending
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last 
Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.
   8)  FEN: NPO for now  with ice chips pending decision on EGD
