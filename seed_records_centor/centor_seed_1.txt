Assessment and Plan:
13 YOF presenting with 3 days of worsening sore throat, fevers and with tonsilar and lymphatic swelling and exudate. Likely Acute viral pharyngitis. Bacterial infection (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis) cannot be completely ruled out without further testing.
Plan
•	Ibuprofen for pain and fever, as well as plenty of fluids and rest. Gargling with warm salt water may also provide some relief.
•	Rapid strep test to rule out streptococcal infection. Will start empiric antibiotics. 
- Patient advised to return or call if symptoms worsen significantly, if fever exceeds 38.9°C (102°F), or if symptoms do not improve in 3-4 days.
