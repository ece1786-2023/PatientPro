   Assessment and Plan
   57M with squamous carcinoma involvement of right face and hostory of
   facial bleeding, DNR/DNI, tranferred from floor with repeat bleeding,
   now tamponaded with pressure dressing.
   .
   #.Facial Bleeding: From large fungating growth of squamous cell
   carcinoma. The patient is s/p 4U transfused blood on [**2198-3-24**]. His BP and
   HR are stable. Hct this AM 32, after no further transfusions.
   -Wound is wrapped,
   -follow Hct q 6 hrs, transfuse while actively bleeding.
   -Support BP with saline and prbcs
   -will need another discussion with family re: goals of care.  He will
   likely bleed again regardless of whether he undergoes embolization or
   not.  In addition, he would require intubation for embolization and he
   has previously documented DNR/DNI.  Will need family discussion re:
   goals of care ASAP, discussion yesterday with sister [**Name (NI) 117**] is for no
   invasive procedures, including intubation.  Sister is screening hospice
   facilities.
   -Palliative care continues to follow, will discuss with them further
   .
   #. Wound: Cultured with acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA.
   S/P full course of vanc/zosyn for VAP, which also covers OSH
   sensitivities.  Started on Keflex on the floor for increased WBC and
   confusion.  Afebrile though with elevated WBC from previous.
   - culture, hold off antibiotics unless positive culture data
   .
   #. AMS: waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], c/w delirium, though currently he is alert.
   ? from underlying neoplastic process, other metabolic abnormalities
   including hypercalcemia, or underlying psych issues.  Afebrile, though
   infection in wound is possible.   CNS infection also a possibility.
   - hold sedating meds if possible but keep pt comfortable
   - watch Calcium and treat for hyperCa with IVF, has already received
   Pamidronate x 1
   - follow
   .
   #. Leukocytosis- possible leukemoid rxn but infection is in
   differential as well. Rising steadily to 64 today.
   - Follow up cx data
   - Currently on NO antibiotics
   .
   #. Hypercalcemia- likely [**2-19**] paraneoplastic process.  Received
   pamidronate x 1.
   - IVF
   .
   # hypernatremia: replace free H2O as needed.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given AMS. Start D51/2 NS at 75cc/hr.
   .
   # PPX- Bowel regimen. pneumoboots. PPI. Avoiding anticoagulation given
   bleeding issues.
   .
   # Code- DNR/[**Name (NI) 4616**] Sister is HCP
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV
   .
   # DISPOSITION: Hoping to clarify goals of care prior to transfer to the
   floor.
