Chief Complaint:  Hypoxia; non-perfused right leg
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10069**] is a 70 yo man with h/o insulin-dependent adult onset
   diabetes mellitus, with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia; as well as
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2131**] and a ~140 pack year smoking history, who was
   transferred at the request of his PCP from the [**Hospital6 2800**] ICU
   to the [**Hospital1 54**] MICU Friday [**2149-8-29**] with respiratory distress and
   hypoglycemia.
   .
   A more extensive pre-hospital course is described in prior notes. In
   brief, over the last 1-2 months he had an unintentional 10 pound weight
   loss. For one week prior to his admission at [**Hospital6 2800**] on
   [**8-25**] he had been having productive cough, fever, and increased fatigue.
   He was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-25**] after being found unresponsive with a
   FSBG of 21. At [**Hospital3 919**] he was treated for hypoglycemia with
   glucagon to good effect; he was also treated for possibly atypical
   pneumonia vs eosinophilic PNA vs inflammation associated with COPD
   exacerbation, with levofloxacin and solumedrol. Also with concern for
   eosinophilic pneumonia his prior Cymbalta was stopped. He was admitted
   to [**Hospital3 919**]; in the setting of a BNP of 9248 he was diuresed with
   Lasix 40 mg IV BID. Solumedrol 60 mg IV q8h was given, with start date
   appearing to be [**2149-8-25**]. On [**8-27**] a chest CT there showed a 4 cm
   spiculated mass in the LLL as well as hilar and mediastinal LAD. While
   on steroids, the patient became hyperglycemic and he was transferred to
   the MICU for insulin gtt. In the MICU he became hypoxic and was placed
   on a NRB. CXR demonstrated bilateral airspace disease, pulmonary edema,
   and possible atypical PNA.
   .
   On transfer to the [**Hospital1 54**] MICU on [**8-29**], his SOB was slightly improved,
   but he felt fatigued, and he was worried about his lung mass. With
   concern for worsening pneumonia, he was initially placed on vancomycin
   and zosyn in addition to continuing his levofloxacin. Prednisone was
   decreased to 60 mg a day. On Saturday [**2149-8-30**], he had three doses of
   lasix 40 mg IV that generated good diuresis. While in the MICU, he
   became hyperglycemic to the 400s requiring insulin gtt & he was placed
   on O2 on the evening of [**8-30**] because his SpO2 was <90.
   .
   On transfer to the general medicine floor he was without LE edema or
   SOB, and reported that he felt back to his pre-hospital baseline. His
   O2 nasal cannula was turned down from 6 L/min to 4 L/min, and his SpO2
   was maintained at 92%. His diabetes continued to prove brittle with
   both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (down to FSG of 34 overnight [**8-31**]).
   .
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes consult service was consulted and left recommendations
   in OMR, emphasizing discontinuation of insulin pump for outpatient
   management (feeling patient was unable to use properly) and changed
   from NPH to glargine for basal control. His blood sugars remained
   labile through the 20th.
   .
   Prednisone taper was continued at what appears to be a rate of 2 days
   each of 60, 40, and 20 mg, with the last dose of 20 mg on [**9-3**].
   Levofloxacin was continued through until [**9-2**] and stopped thereafter.
   The pulmonary service was consulted; their detailed note is in OMR, but
   in broad strokes they considered the management thus far to have been
   reasonable and did not suggest major changes.
   .
   On [**9-1**] a sputum was obtained which eventually showed cytology
   consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. On [**9-3**], prior to this result
   being available, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] (patient's PCP) informed the patient
   that the mass was SCC until proven otherwise; and by [**9-6**], chart notes
   suggest that he had been told about the positive cytology. The several
   teams following him have anticipated an outpatient PET-CT and workup
   with resolution of inflammation.
   .
   By [**9-3**], the medicine team was planning to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 10069**], but he
   was orthostatic when walked with physical therapy; and overnight
   appeared to acutely decompensate and dropped his O2 sat from 93-74% on
   nasal cannula, and was only 80s for a time on venturi mask. Overnight
   [**Date range (1) 10070**], his right leg became mottled and cold; vascular was
   consulted and studies (described below) were performed that showed
   occlusion of his prior fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] bypass graft. A heparin drip was
   started. His CKs were followed closely and were rising rapidly.
   .
   On [**9-6**], the medicine attending covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] discussed
   goals of care with the patient and his wife, who expressed a desire to
   have as much time at home as possible, and who changed his code status
   to DNR/DNI. On [**9-7**], the patient again had oxygen desaturation to 78%
   on 3L NC; this returned to mid-90s with non-rebreather. 1 mg IV
   morphine and 40 mg IV lasix were given. Vancomycin and cefepime were
   ordered. He was transferred to the MICU for closer nursing care and
   close monitoring of respiratory status.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, he was saying that his pain and dyspnea were
   improving with morphine. He noted that he felt his respiratory status
   was improved when lying flat and worse when sitting up. He denied chest
   pain or abdominal pain.

   [**2149-9-5**] 02:44PM    397*
   STUDIES:
   CXR (OSH on [**8-25**]): Diffusely increased interstitial lung markings along
   the periphery of the lungs, likely chronic eosinophilic pneumonia v.
   atypical pneumonia.
   .
   TTE ([**2149-8-25**]): EF estimated at 55%. No diagnostic regional wall motion
   abnormality identified.
   .
   CT Chest ([**2149-8-27**]): 4.1 cm spiculated mass in the LLL concerning for
   neoplasm. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. Bullous
   emphysematous lung changes and chronic interstitial lung changes.
   Ground-glass and patchy opacity likely represents interstitial and
   alveolar edema superimposed on chronic interstitial lung changes. Bulky
   mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Given the patient's left lower lobe
   lung mass, the adenopathy may represent metastatic disease. When the
   patient's acute PNA or CHF resolves, PET-CT imaging may be useful for
   further evaluation. No CT evidence of PE.
   .
   CXR ([**8-29**]): Bilateral airspace disease right greater than left,
   minimally worse as compared to [**8-27**]. Likely represents pulmonary
   edema. Atypical PNA would also be a consideration. Small
   associated pleural effusions.
   .
   CXR [**8-29**] [**Hospital1 **]: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2148-11-24**]. Since the previous 
study, there has been development of reticular
   opacities within the bilateral peripheral lung zones. This may be due
   to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or usual interstitial pneumonitis.
   There is also a more focal opacity within the left lower lobe that
   corresponds to patient's known  mass. Lymphangitic spread of tumor is
   not entirely excluded and if there is high clinical concern, chest CT
   is recommended. There is no pleural effusions. No definite fluid
   overload is present.
   .
   CXR [**8-31**] [**Hospital1 **]: Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is unchanged. There is
   again noted increase reticular density most prominent within the lung
   bases in the periphery with some sparing within the left upper lobe.
   There is also more focal area of consolidation within the left
   retrocardiac area. These findings are stable.
   .
   Echo [**9-1**] [**Hospital1 **]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with low
   normal free wall motion. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
   diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Very mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   .
   Arterial U/S [**9-4**] [**Hospital1 54**]:
   1. No ultrasound evidence of above-knee deep venous thrombosis in
   relation to either lower limb.
   2. There is significant thrombus identified within the right popliteal
   artery, which is almost completely occluded. There is, however, some
   peripheral flow identified. The popliteal artery is non-aneurysmal on
   the right.
   3. There is a small [**Hospital Ward Name 5107**] cyst seen on the right.
   .
   CTA EXT/ABD/PELV [**9-5**] [**Hospital1 54**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Aortobifemoral graft remains patent.
   2. Occlusion of right fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] bypass close to its proximal origin. No
   previous imaging is available to determine the chronicity of occlusion.
   3. Patent bypass from the left common femoral artery to left anterior
   tibial artery.
   4. Diffuse interstitial lung disease and left lower lobe mass as
   identified on prior CT.
   5. Marked distention of the urinary bladder.
   .
   CT HEAD [**9-5**] [**Hospital1 54**]
   Mild brain atrophy and old lacunar infarct in the right thalamus,
   unchanged. No contrast CT evidence of metastatic disease to the brain.
   .
   CXR [**2149-9-7**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-6**], there is little overall
   change. Again there are diffuse reticular markings more prominent on
   the right. Cardiac size remains within overall normal limits. The
   radiographic findings are again consistent with severe pulmonary
   fibrosis, possibly complicated by asymmetric pulmonary edema.
   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 .H/O PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITH CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
   ASSESSMENT: 70yo M with brittle type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, CAD, and CHF
   originally hospitalized for respiratory distress and hypoglycemia
   causing syncope. His respiratory distress was due to a combination of
   COPD exacerbation, ? pneunomia, and CHF exacerbation with overlying
   pulmonary fibrosis. Found to have 4cm diameter spiculated mass on left
   lower lobe of lung suspicious for neoplasm, with sputum cytology
   positive for squamous cell carcinoma. Now, patient with mottled foot
   and popliteal arterial occlusion.
   .
   PLAN:
   # Respiratory Distress: Appears to be resolving on arrival and with
   diuresis here in the unit in first hours here. Acute episode is likely
   related to diastolic CHF. No current evidence for PNA; holding
   antibiotics for now, though with low threshold to restart. Chronic
   pulmonary issues underlying this are harder to discern; eosinophilic
   pneumonia has been a possibility, and given that steroids have been
   restarted, will give consideration to restarting if has accelerating
   worsening.
   - continue to run even to negative but with concern for hydration for
   rhabdo, see below
   .
   # Popliteal Arterial Occlusion: Patient does have capillary refill, and
   suspect this suggests occlusion is responding to heparin and/or
   collateral circulation is emerging. Vascular following; has not had
   plans for revascularization given that some flow appears to be taking
   place clinically (in brief, leg would be black at this point if there
   was no flow; also by my exam cap refill is somewhat reassuring), pt is
   not ideal operative candidate. CK continues to rise and in fact if leg
   is becoming reperfused we may now have higher risk for effects of
   rhabdo and of inflammation associated with reperfusion of ischemic or
   necrotic tissue.
   - continue to discuss w vascular potential and perils of intervention
   - follow CK and creatinine closely, see below
   - watch closely for signs of systemic inflammation; obtain advance
   consent (or refusal) for central line in case pressors needed if high
   degree of reperfusion inflammation
   - rhabdo prevention as below
   .
   # Elevated CK, Risk for rhabdomyolysis
   Elevated CK and likely significant muscle injury from reperfusion,
   acute rise in CK, all concerning for potential for rhabdomyolysis.
   Hypoxia on arrival seemed to improve with diuresis. Delicate fluid
   balance; need to hydrate aggressively balanced with need to keep fluid
   down.
   - run even: likely will need high volume fluids and high volume
   diuresis
   - follow CK and Cr closely
   - HCO3 for IVF for alkalinization
   .
   #. SCC of the Lung: Patient with CT chest demonstrating left lower lobe
   mass concerning for malignancy. An expectorated sputum culture
   demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
   - patient and wife aware of pathologic diagnosis of SCC
   - SW & other support as patient needs
   - Heme/Onc recommended outpatient follow up since it is NSCLC he will
   not need inpatient chemotherapy
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress: Patient completed abx course, steroids tapered
   off, contines to require a minimum of 3L of O2 for sats >90%. However,
   with episodes of dyspnea and hypoxemia to the high 60's/low 70's, that
   resolves with 40% O2. Patient had originally been scheduled for
   bronchoscopy today, but given his vascular concerns, the study was
   cancelled.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations prn dyspnea.
   - Continue attempting to minimize nasal canula O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue to diurese with Lasix. Dose changed to 20 mg PO BID because
   he received 40mg IV overnight.
   .
   # DM2: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs, patient on Glargine 18 units QHS with 
sliding
   scale. Fingersticks improved overnight and this AM. Patient not
   requiring additional insulin and without episodes of hypoglycemia
   overnight.
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   # Physical Therapy. On attempted ambulation with Mr. [**Known lastname 10069**] yesterday
   felt weak and dizzy upon standing up. Othostatics were measured and he
   was found to have orthostatic hypotension. Yesterday he was one liter
   negative after lasix diuresis.
   - Gentle Lasix 20mg PO BID as blood pressure tolerates.
   .
   # CAD: Continue home doses of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**], Carvedilol per outpatient
   regimen
   .
   # Depression: Continuing Sertraline per home regimen.
   .
