Chief Complaint:  GI bleed
   HPI:
   [**Age over 90 **]yoM with h/o COPD and asbestosis as well as recent admission on
   [**9-1**] for altered mental status [**2-7**] dehydration and electrolyte
   abnormalities now with upper GI bleed.  Presented today from home with
   weakness for one week and inability to urinate x1d.  A foley was placed
   with no urine output.  He was thought to be dehydrated and was given
   fluids and had some urine output.  Foley trial was attempted in the ED,
   however pt was unable to void and had suprapubic pain.  The foley was
   then replaced.
   While in ED, patient was noted to have 1 episode of coffee ground
   emesis after eating, approximately 100cc.  He has a distant h/o gastric
   ulcer and current mild GERD symptoms.  NG lavage was attmepted, however
   patient could not tolerate.  Denied other episodes of coffee ground
   emesis, but did have 2 episodes of vomiting the day prior to admission
   and nausea. Denies melena or BRBPR, normal BM.  Guiac negative in ED.
   Seen by GI and plan was to scope on Monday given apparent hemodynamic
   stability.  No previous colonoscopy.
   He was admitted to the medicine floor where he was found to have
   suprapubic and epigastric ttp on exam.  A CT was ordered and while
   taking the oral contrast, had another episode of coffee ground emesis.
   He also developed tachycardia to the 110s.  Hct stable.  Transferred to
   the MICU.

   Imaging: CXR (portable): No free air, however not upright so it can not
   be excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions with prominence of
   interstitial markings that could reflect chronic lung disease, elevated
   pulmonary venous pressure or both. Bibasilar atelectatic  changes, L>R,
   with apparent pleural plaquing.  Pulmonary abnormalities are unchanged
   from prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   #. Coffee Ground Emesis - he has had two episodes of coffee ground
   emesis today with remote history of gastric ulcers.  Concern for upper
   GI bleed.  Pt could not tolerate NG lavage.  Guiac negative. No
   previous colonoscopy.  No h/o liver disease and low suspicion of
   varices.  Has had several episodes of vomiting in past few days,
   however low likelihood of esophageal tear given no bright red blood and
   no report of chest pain.  Given CXR without evidence of free air and
   unremarkable abdominal exma, suspicion of perforated ulcer low.
   - Known to GI who will come to MICU to scope.
   - Protonix gtt
   - Hct q4hr
   - LFTs
   - Hold ASA
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse for hct <21
   .
   #. Low urine output - Concern for urinary retention in setting of BPH
   and a failed voiding trial in ED.  Also with decreased UOP, thought to
   be secondary to dehydration given that it improved with fluids.  Cr
   stable.
   - Monitor UOP with goal 30cc/hr
   - Continue foley until hemodynamicaly stable, then voiding trial
   .
   #. RLQ mass - New mass, which is tender to palpation on exam with
   question of bowel sounds.  Concern for hernia vs reactive lymph node.
   In setting of acuity of GI bleed, will defer further evaluation until
   pt has become more stable.
   - CT abd/pelvis
   .
   #. COPD, asbestosis - on 2L home O2.  Per patient respiratory status is
   at baseline on 2LNC.
   - continue 02
   - continue albuterol nebs
   .
   #. Chronic Renal Failure - At baseline Cr 1.5.
   .
   #. HTN - BP stable
   - hold simvastatin and atenolol in setting of GI bleed
   .
   #. Glaucoma
   - continue eye drops
   .
   #. FEN: NPO
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna
   -Pain management with tylenol
   .
   #. ACCESS: 3 PIVs
   .
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, however after discussion with patient he has
   agreed to change status to full code in the event he will need sedation
   and intubation for scope, with the understanding that his status will
   be returned to DNR/DNI after procedure.
