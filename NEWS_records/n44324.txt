Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2186-4-16**] Events:
   - Pt pulled out PICC
   - IR placed temporary dialysis line with VIP port
   - Has a large hemorrhagic bulla at the site of new line, oozing
   slightly --> wound consult pending.
   - Lactulose started, having large BMs.
   - Cultures: [**4-6**] and [**4-11**]- coag neg staph. sensitivities pending. [**4-15**]-
   GPCs in pairs and chains, lab thinks it's strep rather than staph.
   - EKG not done as adhesives on leads tear out pt's fragile skin. If
   serial EKGs necessary to f/u PR intervals for ?vegetations, should get
   TTE instead. Although, TTE may not be necessary if the most recent
   positive blood culture does turn out to be strep rather than coag neg
   staph as noted in previous blood cultures

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 60 yo woman with h/o cirrhosis
   [**3-13**] MTX and HepC, who presents with acute on chronic renal failure now
   with pulmonary edema in setting of oliguric renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**3-13**] to worsening volume overload after 2
   units PRBC's in patient who is HD dependent at this time.  Unable to
   diurese on floor likely [**3-13**] to renal disease.  Must also consider
   transfusion reaction but timing of the onset is more c/w volume
   overload.  No witnessed aspiration event.  Assymetric lower extremity
   swelling appears chronic
   - Liver recommending against further diuresis given risk to kidneys
   - nitro gtt now
   - oxygen
   - morphine PRN -> but careful given mental status.
   - consider rechallenging with lasix/acetazolamide
   - d/w renal regarding HD, may need IR guided line placement.
   .
   # Hepato-renal syndrome/ARF: Renal on board.  Cr not improving
   octreotide/midodrine/albumin.
   - plan for initiation of HD
   - line placement for HD
   .
   # Coag Neg Staph bacteremia: Pt had increasing encephalopathy on [**2186-4-11**]
   so blood and urine cultures were drawn. Two of two culture bottles
   drawn from her PICC line grew Coag neg staph. Pt started on vancomycin
   IV last dosed on [**2186-4-15**].
   - check vanco level this AM
   - Surveillance BCx
   - PICC is now midline, may need to be replaced.
   .
   #. UTI: Urine Cx from [**3-/2106**] grew ESBL Ecoli, pan-sensitive Klebsiella,
   and MDR Pseudomonas. Had initially been treated with aztreonam but
   changed to meropenem once cultures grew out.  Question of drug reaction
   with eosinophilia and now held.  Repeat cultures negative.
   - Continue to follow UA periodically
   - UCx results pending
   - no antibiotics right now
   - contact precautions.
   .
   #. HCV and MTX Cirrhosis: Currently stable with a MELD of 24.
   - Continue Rifaximin and Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Continue Bactrim SS daily for SBP prophylaxis
   .
   #. Psoriasis: The patient has a history of psoriasis, for which she
   currently takes Triamcinolone [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Continue Triamcinolone cream [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   #. Bullae: The patient has two bullae on her legs, bilaterally, for
   which she was recently hospitalized. The bullae are now much improved,
   and she had a follow up appointment with Dermatology yesterday.
   - Wound Care C/S
   .
   #. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has a history of
   hyperglycemia, thought to be secondary to her tube feeds. Had been on
   RISS on floor, but would change to humalog sliding scale with meals.
   - Continue Glargine and ISS qid
   - FSBG qid
   .
   # Chronic skin changes: Pt with extensive skin breakdown from edema.
   Worsened by multiple daily injections. Also has history of psoriasis.
   - Minimize injections.
   - Continue management of psoriasis
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt with baseline H/H of [**11-4**] or so. H/H have trended down
   this admission. No obvious source of bleeding. VSS. Likely anemia of
   chronic disease
   - T&S up to date
   - Transfuse for H/H < [**8-29**]; received 2 units [**2186-4-15**]
   .
   # ACCESS: PICC (midline now)
