   Assessment and Plan
   1. chest pain
   2. hematemesis
   3. ?elevated amylase / lipase
   4. pulmonary nodules / ?infiltrate
   5. afib
   85M with DM, afib not on anticoagulation,CKD, h/o gastritis, presents
   with chest pain without ekg changes and without troponin elevation from
   baseline, and one episode of hematemesis in the ED. pt is seen by GI
   last night and this am and GI team is considering EGD. For now, the
   patient is stable without any more episodes.
   Patient has a question of a lung infiltrate at the right base. he has
   no fever, wbc elevation or cough. At this point will hold off on
   continuting antibiotics and obtain a pa/lateral.
   Will obtain RUQ ultrasound given mildly elevated amylase and lipase and
   intermittent epigastric pain.
   If hct remains unchanged this early PM, patient is stable for the floor
   today.
