   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with a history Ichemic CM with a history of VTach s/p ICD
   placement, s/p three prior ablations presented on [**12-21**] s/p ICD firing
   x6, now transferred to CCU for recurrent VT, hypotension, and
   amiodarone gtt.
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient with three failed VT ablations in past. Pt's
   Interrogation revealed slow VT, but appropriate fire of ICD. The
   patient has failed medical management of with Mexiletine/Tikosyn and
   plan had been to switch to dronedarone but pt has not been able to get
   insurance approval of dronedarone. With recurrent episode on the floor,
   Amiodarone was added. This event is consistent with history of scar and
   not new ischemia as discussed with EP.
   - continue amiodarone gtt per EP recs
   - check LFTs with amiodarone
   - discontinued Mexiletine/Tikosyn
   - plan for VT ablation on [**2130-12-26**]
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes and keep Mg >2, K >4
   - keep pads on chest
   - will monitor BP closely
   .
   # Pump: Mildly volume overloaded on examination. Patient has ichemic
   dilated CM with low EF of 15%.  Did require 1.3L NS bolus in the
   setting of recent VT on the floor and.
   - Continue Toresmide 60mg daily
   - Continue BB, eplerenone, [**Last Name (un) **]
   - strict I/Os, daily weights, goal I/O even
   - d/c coumadin
   - uptitrate BB, cut back on [**Last Name (un) **] if BP does not tolerate.
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient's CM is related to ischemia, however no cath
   reports are avail to determine coronary anatomy. CAD s/p CABG x 5 '[**18**]
   - Continue Statin, BB, ASA as tolerated
   .
   # HTN:New hypotension in setting of VT.
   - Cont Coreg, Ramipril, Eplerenone with strict holding parameters
   .
   # HPL: Cont statin
   .
   # COPD: Continue inhalers prn
   .
   # FEN: heart healthy, low salt diet, NPO overnight into monday for
   possible procedure

   # ACCESS: PIV's

   # PROPHYLAXIS:
