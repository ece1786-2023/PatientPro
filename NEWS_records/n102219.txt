   pain, or URI symptoms. No recent medication changes, no ACE inhibitor
   use, NSAID or ASA use, travel or new food exposures. She denies
   abdominal pain, rash, pruritus, or hives. She ate a usual dinner of
   chicken and rice and mango juice (which are all typical for her). She
   works at [**Hospital1 49**] in the animal research department and directly handles

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo woman with acute onset throat swelling.
   THROAT SWELLING -- attributable to angioedema
   Less likely is infectious pharyngitis or peritonsilar abscess though pt
   has no pain, no fever, no erythema on exam. She denies rash or
   urticaria making mast-cell mediated less likely. Also, has not taken
   ACE-inhibitor, opioids, NSAIDs, or ASA. She has other potential
   allergic sources - mango juice, animal exposure. [**Month (only) 11**] also be acquired
   angioedema, less likely hereditary.
   - Tryptase level on admission labs to eval for anaphylaxis
   - Consider C1-inhib and complement levels as outpatient
   - Allergy testing as outpatient
   - Prednisone taper 40/20/10
   - Famotidine 40mg po in am
   - Benadryl 25mg q6hr
