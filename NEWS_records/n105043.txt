   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 68**] is a 64 yo male with a history of T1DM s/p cadoveric renal
   transplant, chronic RLE ulcers, and IVC filter on Coumadin, who was
   admitted with mild DKA in the setting of one week of N/V, diarrhea and
   fevers.
   .
   #. DKA: likely [**12-31**] infection; sugars max ~400, but improved to mid
   200's with IV insulin in ED; patient was not on drip.  Potassium
   dropping with improvement in gap, which is now ~14.
   -- will give SQ insulin SS Q2 hours --> will space out to Q4 hours once
   FSG consistently < 200
   -- will treat infection and evaluate for other causes as below
   -- will volume resuscitate with bolus of NS as needed.
   .
   #. NAUSEA/VOMITING, DIARRHEA: IC host from IS for renal transplant.  No
   h/o CP, but at risk for silent MI give DM status.  ? slight Q waves on
   inferior leads.  Also had recent linezolid use for RLE ulcers.
   -- will send urinary Legionella antigen, C. diff, stool cultures
   -- will check cardiac enzymes with am labs, though likely to be
   negative given time course of symptoms.
   .
   #. SOB: CXR clear and unlikely infectious, though with chronic
   cryptococcal PNA; symptoms have been worsening over last couple days.
   Patient anemic but at baseline.  Does not have an O2 requirement
   currently.  CXR clear.   SOB most likely related to patient
s acidosis.
   -- will evaluate for MI, per below
   -- t/c echo if symptoms do not improve with treatment of leg infection,
   t/c adding levofloxacin for Legionella
   -- cont home fluconazole 200 mg QD
   .
   #. RLE ULCER/CELLULITIS: was previously treated with linezolid;
   followed by podiatry as out-patient; seen by vascular and podiatry in
   ED, who had no acute recs
   -- cont. vanco
   -- wound care consult
   # Right Knee pain -  concerning for septic joint vs. bleed into knee
   joint given high INR vs. osteoarthritis
   - plan to tap right knee today for fluid analysis and gram stain.
   .
   #. VOLUME BALANCE:  dehydrated per history, BUN/Cr
   -- will hold home lasix
   -- cont IV fluids w/ K+
   -- Give 1L NS bolus now.   Follow BP and HR.
   .
   #. ANTICOAGULATION: INR 6 down from 20 yesterday after Vit K and FFP
   -- will check INR in am
   -- no evidence of bleeding currently, though will maintain active T&S
   -- patient requires life-long anti-coagulation so no need to fully
   correct.
   -- Holding coumadin.
   .
   #. ARF: Cr 2.1 on admission; with IVF in ED, repeat Cr 1.7 with BUN
   28.  Baseline ~0.9 - 1.0.  Likely mostly prerenal, but patient also
   with poor PO intake and poor absorption in recent week while on
   prednisone/prograf for renal allograft and, thus, at risk for
   rejection.
   -- will cont to monitor response to IVF; cont to follow UOP
   -- f/u renal recs
   .
   # Renal Transplant
 pt is s/p renal transplant with missed doses of
   prednisone and tacrolimus and bump in Cr.  Renal team saw patient in ED
   by report.
   -- will touch base with pt
s renal doctor.
   .
   #. PPX:
   -- INR supratherapeutic; no need for SQH currently
   -- cont home protonix and bowel regimen
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal
 It is possible that patient underestimated current
   EtOH usage.
   --Watch for symptoms of EtOH withdrawal.
   .
   #. FEN:
   -- diabetic diet as tolerated
   -- will cont IVF overnight and reassess volume status in the morning
   .
   #. ACCESS: 2x PIV
   .
   #. CODE: full

   #. DISPO: transfer to floor today.   Notify PCP (followed at [**Company 71**]) of

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Present for key portions of history and physical exam. Agree with
   findings as above. DKA likely precipitated by cellulitis and diarrheal
   illness. We have cultured extensively and are covering broadly with abx
   pending cx.  C Diff pos but seems likely cellulitis is primary. Will
   need observation for withdrawal.  DM not well controlled in past
   would consult [**Last Name (un) 72**] while in hospital.
