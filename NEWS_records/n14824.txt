Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient admitted on [**2121-12-18**] for vascular surgery evaluation of right
   heel ulcer.  She was started on vanco/cipro/flagyl on admission to
   cover an infection.  On hospital day 2 ([**2121-12-19**]), she underwent right
   peroneal angioplasty on [**2121-12-19**] and was put on an argatroban drip for
   24 hours following hte procedure.  On [**12-20**], she was noted to be
   hypotensive to 72/37 and hypothermic to 94.6.  Cardiac enzymes were
   check and were noted to be positive.  She was transfused 2 units PRBCs
   on [**12-20**]. Plastic surgery was consulted for evaluation of sacral decub,
   but declined to debride wound due to aspirin/plavix/argatroban use.
   She underwent HD on [**2121-12-21**], but they were unable to remove fluid due
   to low blood pressures.  When renal evaluted her on that day, there was
   concern that her mental status was not at baseline and her words were
   not well enunciated.  They recommended sending blood cultures and
   broadening antibiotics but this was not done.  Cardiology was consulted
   on [**12-21**] for bradycardia, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes,
   who had no specific recommendations other than to d/c beta-blockers.
   An echo was performed on [**12-22**] which showed new regional wall motion
   abnormalities. Given hypotension, anasarca, and inability to tolerate
   HD due to low BPs, patient was transfered to MICU for CVVH.
   Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports right hand pain.  She denies
   any other complaints.  No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
   fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroeneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and need for more
   aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and hx of
   MI and relatively preserved EF and poor nutritional status (chronically
   low albumin).  We can consider albumin infusions although these are
   only temporizing.  Tough to interpret the cortisol in this patient
   would be hesitant to give stress dose steroids for now given wound
   impairment if progressively hypotensive then would favor steroid
   repletion. Finally would check TFTs as she is hypothyroid as well.
   Finally , her  chronic anemia is compounding her picture and would
   favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25
   - pressor support to allow diuresis
   - nutrition consult
   - TFT
   - defer empiric stress dose steroids
   - transfuse for Hct > 25
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line placed
   today.
   - CVVH with goal of 200-300 cc/hour
   - levophed to maintain MAPs> 65 so CVVH can be tolerated
   >CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   - aspirin, plavix, statin
   - hold BB due to hypotension
   .
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICU.
   - free water restrict
   - fluid removal with CVVH
   - d/c D51/2NS
   - follow Na
   > Leukocytosis.  WBC has been elevated since admission on [**12-18**], though
   is rising of the past few days.  Patient has had no documented fevers,
   though as been hypothermic several times during hospital stay,
   concerning for infectious etiology.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub, vs OM right heel ulcer, c. dif given
   the recent Abx, blood. Will treat with empiric flagyl until c.dif.
   returns, meropenem and cipro for gram neg coverage given hx of DM and
   resistant pseudomonas pathogens, daptomycin for gram postive given hx
   of VRE.
   - follow WBC
   - check ESR, plain films of the heel
   - continue broad spectrum abx
   - plastic surgery consult to help with management of decub ulcer.
   - follow fever curve
   - follow up blood cultures, stool culture,
   > RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**2121-12-23**].  Concerning for cellulitis,
   particularly in setting of rising WBC and hypotension.
   - continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow fever, wbc curve
   >Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   - vitamin K
   - follow coags
