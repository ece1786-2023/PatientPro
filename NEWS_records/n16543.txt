Chief Complaint:  Obtundation
   HPI:
   This is a 56yo woman with hepatic sarcoidosis and regenerative
   hyperplasia on transplant list s/p TIPS [**12/2109**] placed [**3-16**] variceal
   bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy s/p TIPS re-do with
   angioplasty and portal vein embolectomy, s/o multiple SBOs s/p ex lap
   [**12-20**] with multiple complications including seizures and wound
   infections on vanco/caspo, sent to ED when outpatient labs showed Cr of
   2.7 and vanco level of 75.4. Patient overall had no new complaints, was
   feeling at her recent baseline. No problems with [**Name2 (NI) 898**] infusion or wound
   dressing changes at home. Does note 2-3 days of increased slurred
   speech and reported jaundice noticed by husband. [**Name (NI) 59**] increased abdominal
   girth. Also with generalized weakness but more left-sided weakness for
   last 3 weeks. Denies fever, chills, cough, pain on urination, has been
   having normal BMs for her.
   .
   In ED, initial VS: 97.6 64 115/66 18 99%. Patient had CT abd/pelvis to
   eval midline belly wound which incidentally showed partial SBO and RLL
   PNA. Patient passing stool and flatus, pt without abdominal pain, n/v.
   Patient positive for asterixis. Labs significant for anemia, Hct 22.7,
   vanco level of 75.4, Cr 2.7 (recent baseline 1.4-1.6), alk phos 361.
   Patient was typed and crossed, CT head showed no acute intracranial
   process. Hepatology and transplant surgery consulted and wanted to
   continue vanco/caspo.
   On the floor, she initially was stable, receiving lactulose and had
   multiple BM's today. Caspo was d/c
d on [**3-10**]. However, she
   progressively became more altered throughout the day until in the
   evening, she was found to be obtunded by her nurse. This afternoon, she
   underwent an MRI of her head, followed by an ultrasounded guided
   paracentesis.  She was given both fluids and Ativan during her
   paracentesis procedure.  She withdraws to painful stimulus and is
   breathing on her own. An ABG was significant for only a mild metabolic
   acidosis. FS was wnl. Pupils were equal and there was no evidence of
   seizure activity. She was protecting her airway, so she was transferred
   to the MICU for further management.
   In the ICU, she was beginning to wake up slightly, arousing to voice
   but quickly falling asleep again. She would not follow commands.

   FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
   large areas of edema or mass effect. Again noted is
   encephalomalacic changes of the right frontotemporal lobe with ex
   vacuo effect of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 1347**], unchanged. There is
   normal preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 734**]- white matter differentiation. The
   ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The
   coil in the region of the right middle cerebral artery
   bifurcation is unchanged but limits evaluation as there is
   extensive associated streak artifact in the area of the
   cerebellum and skull base. Aerosolized secretions are seen in the
   sphenoid sinus with a small amount of layering fluid.
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. Stable
   encephalomalacic changes of the right frontotemporal lobe.
   Sphenoid sinus disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with hepatic sarcoidosis on transplant list s/p TIPS, s/p
   multiple SBOs s/p ex lap [**12-20**] complicated by seizures and wound
   infections on vanco/caspo, admitted with acute on chronic renal
   failure, supratherapeutic [**Month/Year (2) 898**], slurred speech, and left-sided weakness
   now with obtundation in the setting of HE and ativan administration.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Etiologies include encephalopathy exacerbated
   by ativan administration, GIB,  infection (including CNS - but very
   unlikely), abdominal (para r/o SBP today), pulmonary (lungs clear,
   satting well, breathing comfortably, however ?RLL pna seen on lung cuts
   of CT abd), UTI (UA was unremarkable), uremia, intracranial bleed,
   seizure (no evidence of seizure activity clinically).  Per neurology,
   most consistent with a  toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, possibly an
   amalgamation of her uremia, electrolyte imbalance (hypernatremia,
   hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia), and ongoing infections. Furthermore
   these abnormalities may be effecting a recrudescence of her old stroke
   symptoms.
   - empiric abx to cover CNS infections recommended by liver team, but
   this is low on the differential; will start meropenem, also to cover
   aspiration pna
   - stat head CT to rule out intracranial bleed
   - blood, urine cx
   - PR lactulose, as MS improves, place NGT and start rifaximine
   - avoid intubation for now, patient seems to be protecting her airway
   for now.
   - aspiration precautions
   - if not clearing, consider LP
   - neuro recs -> EEG
   .
   # Slurred speech/left-sided weakness: see discussion above, re:
   unmasking of old stroke in the setting of infection and HE.
   - follow neuro exam
   - continue keppra and dilantin for seizure ppx, converted to IV
   - check dilantin level in AM
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr up to 2.7 from recent baseline of
   1.6. [**Month (only) 60**] be [**3-16**] decreased flow to kidneys (from hepatorenal syndrome,
   cardiomyopathy), from medications (patient started on [**Month/Day (2) 898**]/caspo since
   last Cr check), or infection. Likely also is not clearing vanco as her
   vanco level was found to be supratherapeutic. Patient does not have
   known hepatorenal syndome but need to follow renal function closely.
   Urine is positive for eos, ?AIN.
   - strict I/Os
   - follow Cr
   - renally-dose meds
   - hold vanco for now, recheck level tomorrow AM
   .
   # Partial SBO: patient with h/o SBO both managed conservatively in
   past, and also s/o s/p ex lap [**12-20**] with multiple complications
   including seizures and wound infections on vanco/caspo. Transplant
   surgery saw patient down in ED, and reviewed CT scan - no evidence of
   complete SBO or symptoms such as abdominal pain, N/V/constipation.
   Patient passing flatus/stool, so no NG tube decompression necessary.
   - transplant surgery following, appreciate recs
   - closely follow abdominal exam and symptoms - if any evidence of
   worsening, call surgery
   .
   # Wound infection: Just discharged [**2-28**] on [**Month/Year (2) 898**]/caspo for wound
   infection after ex lap for SBO. Procedure c/b wound infection and
   subsequent wound dehiscence requiring closure of dehiscence of
   abdominal wall and closure of ascites leak,local cellulitis. Cultures
   from wound infection had grown Klebsiella oxytoca and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**].
   Currently patient with no fevers, or abcess seen on CT scan and wound
   appears c/d/i. Still on [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 898**], but being held for supratherapeutic
   levels. Caspo d/c
   - general surgery service aware
   - continue to check [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 898**] levels, restart when levels in therapeutic
   range
   - continue dressing changes with packing for abd wound
   .
   # Hepatic sarcoidosis c/b portal hypertensive gastropathy s/p TIPS and
   TIPS-redo: Patient with multple complications from this including s/p
   TIPS [**12-19**] and [**5-20**]; TIPS re-do's with angioplasty and portal vein
   embolectomy; severe portal hypertensive gastropathy; Grade II varices;
   grade 3 esophagitis.
   - RUQ US with dopplers to evaluate for TIPS flow, portal vein
   thrombosis  - read pending
   - continue prednisone for sarcoid
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - continue nadolol, spironolactone via NGT once patient's MS has
   improved
   .
   #. Possible RLL pneumonia: seen on CT pelvis. White count around
   patient's baseline, with neutrophil predominance. Patient with multiple
   antibiotic allergies including cipro/levo/cefepime (use caution when
   starting beta lactams)
   - patient already on [**Month/Year (2) 898**], starting meropenem
   - repeat CXR in AM, follow symptoms, and broaden coverage if indicated
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient typed, cross, received 1 unit in ED. No active
   bleeding, Hct within recent baseline, no hematemesis, BRBPR or melena.
   Guaiac negative
   - continue to guaiac given new AMS
   .
   #. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%): No evidence of overload on
   exam but will be careful with fluids
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weights
   .
   #. COPD: no wheezing on exam, no oxygen requirement
   - nebulizers prn
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:
   - continue on home levothyroxine, converted to IV
