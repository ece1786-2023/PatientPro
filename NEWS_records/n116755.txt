   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 6268**] is a 31 year odl female with ESRD on HD admitted with
   epistaxis and anemia.
   .
   # Epistaxis/acute blood loss anemia: Etiology of her epistaxis unknown,
   no longstanding hx of nosebleeds; no hx of vonWillebrand's or
   hemophilia. Issue currently exacerbated by uremia. Baseline hct unknown
   but likely low given ESRD. Seen by ENT who feel most consistent with
   arterial spasm. Anterior packing in place with no further active
   bleeding apparent. Received DDAVP in ED.  Received 2units PRBC
   yesterday with hct this AM 24.1 from 19.6.
   - Trend hct Q12H
   - Maintain active
   - appreciate ENT evaluation/input
   - merocel in place x 5 days
   - keflex for staph coverage
   - afrin at bedside
   - humidified air
   - after the packing is removed, she should start nasal saline sprays
   TID x10 days and apply a very small amount of bacitracin to the left
   anterior nose [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days
   - follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic on day 5 (Thursday) for packing removal
   .
   # ESRD: [**2-14**] to childhood reflux, HD-dependant. Significant uremia,
   stable potassium, stable clinical mental status.  Dialysis dates are
   M/W/F. Getting blood products with volume and K. Not currently volume
   overloaded.
   - Dialysis fellow aware
   - HD today

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 31F ESRD on HD, epistaxis and anemia. Stable
   post total of 4units PRBCs.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.8 BP 150/90 HR 76 RR 18 with sat 99 on RA.
   Drowsy, WD woman. Coarse BS. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. No edema, L fistula.
   Labs notable for WBC 6K, HCT 24, K+ 5.0, Cr 9.8.
   Agree with plan to manage epistaxis with packing, antibiotics (keflex
   PO), and ENT f/u. Anemia is due to blood loss and chronic renal
   disease. Continue epo and serial HCTs. Will go for HD in dialysis unit
   today. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Total time: 25 min
