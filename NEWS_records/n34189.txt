TITLE: PGY3 MICU Admission Note
   Chief Complaint:  abd pain and altered mental status
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1833**] is an 80 y/o man with PMH notable for ESRD on HD and recent
   SDH s/p Burr hole sent to the ED for altered mental status.  He was at
   his nursing home and found to have altered mental status at 8:30 am. At
   that time, T 96.5, P 123, BP 120/70, RR 40, 93% on NRB and 88% on NC
   (later reported 83% on RA). He was diaphoretic at the time FSBS 145.
   Per NH reports, he had dialysis on [**10-13**]. He was sent to the [**Hospital 358**]
   Hospital emergency room for further evaluation. There, he was noted to
   have a rectal temp 100.7, RR 30, P 117, and BP 112/90. His O2 sat was
   98% on NRB. CXR showed left base atelectasis versus infiltrate; CT head
   demonstrated SDH and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   evaluation with neurosurgery.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals BP 85/48, HR 110, RR 24, 100% on NRB. He was
   found to be hyperkalemic and received calcium gluconate, D50/insulin.
   Due to decreased mental status, he was intubated with 20 mg etomidate
   and 40 mg rocuronium. He was hypotensive to the 70s/50s and started on
   levophed gtt. Right femoral CVL was placed for IV access. He was noted
   to have dark brown output (400 cc in total) from his NGT. He received 2
   U FFP and vitamin K as well as profilin (activated factor 9). He
   received vancomycin 1 g X 1 and zosyn.
   On arrival to the ICU, the patient he was intubated and sedated with
   markedly distended abdomen.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o man with ESRD on HD and SDH s/p recent evacuation per NSG
   admitted with altered mental status.
   # Shock, likely septic in etiology: Potential sources include urine
   (though only 6-10 WBCs with culture pending) and intra-abdominal.
   Should also consider CNS source with recent instrumentation. Of these
   most concerning would be mesenteric ischemia secondary to atrial
   fibrillation
   - aggressive volume repletion to CVP 10-12
   - continue vasopressors as necessary
   - surgery consult for acute abdomen
   - broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn)
   - echocardiogram in AM given prior MI
   # Altered mental status: likely related to abdominal sepsis in
   compromised host. no clear change in head imaging per Neurosurg to
   explain.
   - repeat head CT tomorrow AM to re-evaluate size of bleed
   - Neurosurgery team following
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection during altered
   mental status. currently oxygenation well on current vent settings.
   - continue current vent settings with wean FIO2 by sats
   - VAP prevention bundle
   - PPI
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Renal team consulted from ED
   # Elevated INR: Unclear if drawn from heparinized line or due to
   primary coagulopathy (i.e., DIC). Platelets normal so DIC less likely.
   Received vitamin K and FFP in the ED with plan for reversal to < 1.4
   per NSG.
   - repeat coags
   # Hepatitis: likely related to shock liver from sepsis
   # FEN:  NPO
   # ACCESS: Right femoral line, AV fistula.
   # PPx: no heparin given, [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, no need for bowel meds currently
