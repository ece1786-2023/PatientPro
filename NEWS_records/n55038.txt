   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p MI, NSCLC, and
   diverticulosis who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1896**] for LGIB and chest pain and is
   transferred to the MICU for management of worsened LGIB.
   # GI bleed:  Likely lower GI diverticular bleed, as patient has BRBPR
   and history of severe diverticulosis.  Also on differential are colonic
   mass, AVM, and colitis, though these are less likely.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable but history of CAD places him at higher risk of
   demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.  S/p 1U prbc yesterday.
   - Colonoscopy without evident source b ut multiple diver/la.
   - Maintatin 3 PIVs (18G) for access
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - hct checks q6hr (10 am, 4 PM)
   - transfuse to maintain hct of 30
   - F/U surgery
   # CAD: Has history of prior NSTEMIs and is s/p PCI.  Positive troponin
   and neg CK/CK-MB during this admission suggests prior ACS vs demand
   ischemia in the setting of anemia, though lowest hct only 28.  Given
   risk of life threatening bleed, will hold aspirin for now; plavix and
   heparin were not started after admission b/c of bleeding.  CP free at
   this time.  Discussed with cards fellow.
   - not on beta blocker at home and would not start at this time
   - hold aspirin, restart low dose aspirin once HCT stabilizes. d/c
   plavix.
   - continue statin
   # NSCLC: Has stage IIb lesion in RUL diagnosed in [**2-25**], s/p
   chemotherapy and radiation.  Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**].
   - will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4197**] as an outpatient
   # BPH: Stable.
   - Continue finasteride
   # Dyslipidemia:
   - Continue simvastatin.
