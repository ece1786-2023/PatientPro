   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10185**] is a 24 year old man with a history of non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, NYH Class II CHF, EF 15-20% who presents with acute on
   chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1. Acute on Chronic CHF Exacerbation: Underlying etiology was presumed
   to be viral in origin, could also be related to cocaine use in year
   prior to diagnosis or alcohol abuse.  All lab testing negative except
   RSV, including HIV, EBV, CMV, Lyme, RPR.  Current exacerbation likely
   due to poor compliance as patient does not weigh himself.  Appears to
   be taking medications as prescribed and does not report missing any
   doses.  No current evidence (enzyme, ekg) of ischemic event.
   PLAN FOR [**2191-12-25**]
   - will continue diuresis with Lasix, additional 40mg IV now (80 mg
   total)
   - monitor Is/Os; goal negative 1-2 liters/day
   - checking iron studies, consider IV iron replacement
   - electrolyte repletion
   - fluid restrict 2000ml
   - continue b-blockade with Toprol XL 75mg PO BID per Dr.[**Name (NI) 10186**] note
   - continue rule out with cardiac enzymes (negative x 2)
   - full dose aspirin for LV thrombus prevention
   - continue Digoxin, will re-load due to low Digoxin level with 0.5mg X
   1, then 0.25mg. [**Month (only) 11**] need higher dose if subtherapeutic
   - ECG in AM
   - tell EP that patient is in house, they may implant AICD
   .
   2. Tachycardia: Sinus rhythm.  Per prior records, this is likely
   chronic.  CHF exacerbation may be contributing. SO
   - continue home dose of Metoprolol for sinus tachycardia
   .
   3. SOB: resolving. certainly related to CHF exacerbation. Given swift
   response to lasix, chronic tachycardia (below baseline) lack of risk
   factors (no immobility, plane trips, hx) for VTE, we did not check
   d-dimer.
   - tx with diuresis
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: No evidence of infection based on exam.  Appears
   chronic compared to prior levels.  Likely stress response.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   5. Microcytic, Mild Anemia: has had rectal bleeding with negative CT
   colon in past. Has very low EF, may be chronically hemolyzing. Is HbAC,
   this is just the C-trait carrier phenotype and likely does not explain
   his microcytosis.
   -
   - iron studies
   - IV iron can improve symptoms.
   .
   FEN:  cardiac, low sodium diet; fluid restrict 2000ml
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC Heparin
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna
